    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="aboutMe" class="contentSec">
        <h2 class="heading text-center">About Me</h2>
        <p class="aboutMe text-center">I am Cape Town born and bred, I grew up in the quiet area of Glen Cairn, nested on the mountain between Fish Hoek and Simon's Town.
            I attented Bay Primary School grades 1 through 7. Even before I left primary school I knew that that system of education didn't suit me. Later on when I was in
             Matric I decided to dropout and pursue a deferent means of Education. It was at this time that I enrolled myself in a online GED Course. After just a year I had 
             passed all of the written exam with a rather high final score for each. However there was a world-wide hiccup along the way: COVID-19. Luckly I was still able to 
             write my final exams when the college I studied through reopened. Moving forward I was unsure of what I wanted to do, I deeply romanticized the idea of studying 
             Mechanical-Engineering as my mind was always rather analytical. However I quickly found out that most universities didn't recognize the GED as a school-leaving 
             equivalent. Thus I continued to look for something that was close to my heart. Food. My farther was a chef and my Mother and brothers had all been waiters. It was 
             now clear, I would move into hospitality. After some searching I heard that Chef's Warehouse was opening a new restaurant in Hout Bay, which is where I happened to 
             be living at the time. It was a golden oppotunity, to begin in such a prestigious establishment. I began my as a runner and quickly worked to memorize all of the menu 
             items. A few weeks down the line, I got my first table. It was pure joy, to be working with such talented colleagues. However as the months flew by as it became apparent that despite 
             my love of the hospitality, it wasn't what I wanted to spend my life doing and being inherently introverted definitely helped my descision to leave. I wanted to pursue 
             programming. I had grown up as a heavy computer user and the continued development of the tech industry intrigued me. I started learning python and keeping my eye open for
             promising bootcamps. It was then that my brother called me about the open day at CodeSpace. I went and I was amazed, it was the exact oppotunity I had been searching for, 
             I knew it was right. I enrolled and here I am!
